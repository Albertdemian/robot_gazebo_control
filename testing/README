three tests are performed 

first test
unit test "joint_ctrl_fn_test.py" it tests the functions that controller uses to calculate angles

the test runs to check if at any instance the controller output would exceed joints limits

test succeeded. 

second test 

unit test "publisher_test.py"
it tests the controller publisher if it actually publishes to joint control topics 


third test was suppsed to be integration 
the goal was to write two subscribers one for joint_states_commands and the other for ros/joinstates

the problem I couldn't retrieve readings into variables 
the goal of test is to check if the controller function actually moves the robot in gazebo.
